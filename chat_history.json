    "bot_response": "For rose plants, a favourable weather condition is:\n\n* Temperature: 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (59\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)\n* Sunshine: Full sun to partial shade (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight)\n* Humidity: Moderate (around 40-60%)\n\nIn your current weather in Sialkot, PK (23\u00b0C, haze), the temperature is suitable for rose plants. However, the haze might reduce sunlight intensity, which could impact plant growth. Ensure your rose plant receives some direct sunlight and maintain adequate watering to compensate for the hazy conditions.",
